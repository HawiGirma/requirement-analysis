# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction

This repository is created to demonstrate the concept and practice of requirement analysis in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). 

Requirement analysis is a crucial phase that involves gathering, analyzing, and documenting stakeholders' needs to ensure the successful delivery of software solutions. 

It helps in defining project scope, preventing scope creep, and guiding the development team through well-defined functional and non-functional requirements.
